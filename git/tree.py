        # commit_context (A string with ID of the commit) is a "crutch" that
        # allows us to look up details for submodules, should we find any in
        # this particular tree.
        # Trees don't have a reference to parent (commit, other tree).
        # They can have infinite amounts of parents.
        # However, we need to know what commit got us to this particular
        # tree if we want to know the URI of the submodule.
        # The commit ID of the repo pointed out by submodule is here, in the tree.
        # However, the only way to know what URI that submodule refers to is
        # to read .gitmodules file that's in the top-most tree of SOME commit.
        # Each commit can have a different version of .gitmodule, but through 
        # tree chain lead to the same Tree instance where the submodule is rooted.
        # 
        # There is a short-cut. If submodule is placed in top-most Tree in a 
        # commit (i.e. submodule's path value is "mysubmodule") the .gitmodules
        # file will be in the same exact tree. YEY! we just read that and know
        # the submodule's URI. Shortcut is gone when submodule is nested in the
        # commit like so: "commonfolder/otherfolder/mysubmodule" In this case,
        # commit's root tree will have "Tree 'commonfolder'" which will have 
        # "Tree "otherfolder", which will have "Submodule 'mysubmodule'"
        # By the time we get to "Tree 'otherfolder'" we don't know where to
        # look for ".gitmodules". This is what commit_context is for.
        # The only way you get a value here if you either set it by hand, or

        # populates the context upon Tree instantiation.
