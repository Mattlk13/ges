This project's code is designed to fulfill several deployment scenarios. 
These are *some* of the targeted scenarios:

- command-line execution (blocks console until keyboard interrupt)
- Deployment with various WSGI servers like:
	- Cherrypy, WSGI mode.
	- Apache mod_WSGI (*nix, Windows)
	- Microsoft IIS 6,7.x (ISAPI_WSGI + cPython, NWSGI + IronPython)

General notes:
1. This project relies on a git executable to be present and visible on the path.
There is no way to tell the server the path to git executable.
Please, ensure that running "git" in the console produces git executable output. 
On *nix-like systems, installing git package usually exposes that by default.
On Windows, you have choice - cygwin or MSysGit. Either way,
make sure to add git.exe's folder to the PATH list.

2. This project's code, unfortunately, is not compatible with cPython 3.x at this time.
If you have both 2.x and 3.x branches of Python installed, you will need to make sure
that GES is running against 2.x version. Wherever you see this:
"Run GES by running 'ges.py'" replace that with platform-appropriate version of 
this "Run GES by running '\path\to\python.exe ges.py'"

INSALLATION:

Please, pick (cd to) some folder where GES's executable and supporting resources folder will be placed.
Open command line console and run the following command:

git clone git://gitorious.org/ges/ges.git
or 
git clone git://github.com/dvdotsenko/ges.git

RUN:

See individual folders under doc folder for deployment instructions.

In it's simplest form, just try double-clicking the ges.py file and using
the settings (url, port) auto-picked by the server and displayed in
console output will be fine. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.
